Preprocess & Extract Frames:Use embeddings (e.g., BERT) and sentiment analysis to convert and analyze policy and news data.Dependency Parsing: Break down sentences into grammatical structures (subjects, verbs, objects).Latent Dirichlet Allocation (dp-sent-LDA): Group parsed sentences into latent topics using LDA.Apply Attention Mechanism:Focus on key data segments (dp-sent-LDA and embeddings) to prioritize relevant information forÂ predictions.

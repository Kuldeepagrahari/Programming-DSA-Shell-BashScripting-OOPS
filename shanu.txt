Subject: Application for Admission Fee Withdrawal

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to request a withdrawal of my admission fee for the BSc Mathematics course, which I submitted on May 7th, 2024. Unfortunately, due to a misunderstanding regarding the transport facilities, I find myself unable to continue with the admission process.

During the counseling session, I was informed by the counseling personnel that the university bus services would cover my locality. This information significantly influenced my decision to proceed with the admission. However, after the completion of all necessary processes and the payment of the admission fee, the Transport Department informed me that the bus services do not, in fact, extend to my area. Consequently, I am unable to arrange alternative transportation that would allow me to attend classes regularly.

Given these circumstances, I kindly request a withdrawal of my admission fee. 

I appreciate your understanding and consideration of my situation. 

Yours sincerely,
